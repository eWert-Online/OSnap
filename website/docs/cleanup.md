# Cleanup Command

The cleanup command removes all base images which are not used anymore. <br />
This may happen, because you deleted or renamed a test.

You may add the `--config` option, if your config file is not in the default location.

**Usage:**

```bash
osnap cleanup
```

or

```bash
osnap cleanup --config [PATH TO CONFIG]
```
