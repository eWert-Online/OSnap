# Actions

As seen in the [configuration options](configuration) of a test file, you are able to run some actions, before the screenshot will be taken.

This is useful to bring the page into a specific state, you want to capture. <br />
**For example:** opening a dropdown, typing something in an input or waiting for an animation to be completed.

The currently available actions are `wait`, `click` and `type`. They may be configured like this.

:::info
All actions may be configured with the optional `@` key.
It configures the sizes this action is run on. <br />
If `@` is not present, the action runs on all sizes.

## Action Types

### Wait

#### Options:

- `timeout`: The number of ms to wait, before executing the next action or taking the screenshot.

#### Example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML" default>

```yaml
- "@": ["xxl"]
  action: "wait"
  timeout: 2000
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="json" label="JSON">

```json
[
  {
    "@": ["xxl"],
    "action": "wait",
    "timeout": 2000
  }
]
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Click

#### Options:

- `selector`: A css selector of an element which should be clicked. If the selector evaluates to multiple elements, only the first one is clicked.

#### Example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML" default>

```yaml
- "@": ["xxl"]
  action: "click"
  selector: "#id-to-click"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="json" label="JSON">

```json
[
  {
    "@": ["xxl"],
    "action": "click",
    "selector": "#id-to-click"
  }
]
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Type

#### Options:

- `selector`: A css selector of an element which should be typed in. If the selector evaluates to multiple elements, the first one will be used.
- `text`: The text to type into the element

#### Example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML" default>

```yaml
- "@": ["xxl"]
  action: "type"
  selector: "#search"
  text: "some searchword"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="json" label="JSON">
